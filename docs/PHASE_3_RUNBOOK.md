## 1. Bootstrap the very first super-admin (PR 3.1)

The admin tier is **invite-only by design** — there is no self-signup, and
the magic-link form refuses to create new `auth.users` rows
(`shouldCreateUser: false` in
[`src/app/[locale]/auth/login/actions.ts`](../src/app/%5Blocale%5D/auth/login/actions.ts)).
That keeps drive-by visitors from seeding accounts, but it also means the
first super-admin must be created manually. Do this once per environment
(local Supabase, then production).

### Step 1 — Add the user to `auth.users` (with a password)

> **Updated for the email + password flow (PR phase-3-auth-password).**
> Magic-link OTP is deprecated; admins sign in with email + password.
> Supabase's invite email is no longer part of the bootstrap path
> because Supabase Hobby SMTP is unreliable — set the password directly
> via SQL and hand the credentials to the admin out of band.

**Recommended — Supabase Studio → Add user → Create new user.**

1. Open <https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvjmnwsqaymkxcsabjur/auth/users>
   (or local Studio at <http://localhost:54323>).
2. Click **Add user → Create new user** (NOT "Send Invitation").
3. Fill the form:
   - **Email**: `owner@al-hewal.sa`
   - **Password**: a strong one — share via your password manager / encrypted channel
   - **Auto-confirm user**: ✅ checked
4. Submit. **Copy the new user's UUID** from the users list — you'll need it for step 2.

**Power-user path — SQL.**

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor. Replace the email + password.
insert into auth.users (id, email, email_confirmed_at, encrypted_password,
                        raw_app_meta_data, raw_user_meta_data)
values (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'owner@al-hewal.sa',
  now(),
  extensions.crypt('ReplaceWithStrongPassword!', extensions.gen_salt('bf')),
  '{"provider":"email","providers":["email"]}'::jsonb,
  '{}'::jsonb
)
returning id, email;
```

**Resetting an existing admin's password (no email required).**

```sql
update auth.users
   set encrypted_password = extensions.crypt('NewStrongPassword!', extensions.gen_salt('bf')),
       email_confirmed_at = coalesce(email_confirmed_at, now())
 where email = 'owner@al-hewal.sa';
```

This is the canonical recovery path when the admin can't receive
email — bypasses Supabase SMTP entirely.

### Step 2 — Insert the matching `public.admins` row

The middleware + `/auth/callback` route both reject sign-ins that don't
have a matching row in `public.admins` with `status='active'`.

```sql
-- Replace the UUID with the one from step 1, and the email/full_name to taste.
insert into public.admins (id, email, full_name, tier, status, language_pref)
values (
  '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',  -- ← paste the auth.users.id here
  'owner@al-hewal.sa',
  'Al Hewal Owner',
  'super_admin',
  'active',
  'ar'
);
```

### Step 3 — First sign-in

1. Visit `/<locale>/auth/login` (e.g. `https://al-hewal.com/ar/auth/login`).
2. Enter the email + password set in step 1. Submit.
3. The action calls `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`, looks up the
   `public.admins` row, signs the HMAC session cookie (1-hour TTL),
   and redirects to `/<locale>/admin`.

If anything goes wrong, the form surfaces an inline error:

| Error key          | Cause                                           | Fix                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `wrongCredentials` | Email or password incorrect                     | Re-enter; reset via SQL above if forgotten |
| `notAdmin`         | Authenticated but no active `public.admins` row | Re-run step 2                              |
| `supabase`         | Network / Supabase outage                       | Retry; check Vercel logs                   |

If the admin **forgets the password**, two recovery options:

1. **`/<locale>/auth/forgot`** — Supabase emails them a reset link.
   Subject to the same SMTP-reliability issues noted above; OK for
   occasional self-service when email is working.
2. **SQL reset** (from step 1's "Resetting an existing admin's
   password" snippet) — bypasses email entirely. Use this when SMTP
   is flaky.

### Step 4 — Subsequent admins (after PR 3.4)

PR 3.4 ships the in-app super-admin → invite flow. Until then, every new
admin needs the same steps 1+2.

---

## 2. Required environment variables (Phase 3 additions)

| Var                  | Where to set                                                | How to generate                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET` | `.env` + Vercel (Production + Preview + Development scopes) | 32+ chars of high-entropy random. `openssl rand -hex 32` on bash/WSL/mac, or PowerShell: `-join ((1..64) \| ForEach-Object { '{0:x}' -f (Get-Random -Maximum 16) })` |

Rotation cadence: quarterly per [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md). Rotation
forces every active admin to sign in again once — no other side-effects.

In CI, the workflow file at
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) pins a
deterministic test value so the cookie round-trip in
[`tests/unit/lib/auth/session.test.ts`](../tests/unit/lib/auth/session.test.ts)
is reproducible.

---

## 3. Configure Supabase Auth redirect URLs

For every Supabase Auth email flow (legacy magic-link, password
recovery, invite acceptance) to land back on the site, the
`redirectTo` URL has to be allowlisted in the Supabase dashboard.

1. Open <https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvjmnwsqaymkxcsabjur/auth/url-configuration>.
2. Add to **Redirect URLs** (Allow List), once per environment:
   - **Legacy magic-link (PR 3.1)** — `*/auth/callback`:
     - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
     - `https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback` (covers preview deploys)
     - `https://al-hewal.com/auth/callback` (production — adjust to the real domain)
   - **Invite + password-recovery (PR #34 / #35)** — `*/auth/recovery`:
     - `http://localhost:3000/auth/recovery`
     - `https://*.vercel.app/auth/recovery`
     - `https://al-hewal.com/auth/recovery`
3. Set **Site URL** to the production domain (`https://al-hewal.com`).
4. Save.

Without these, Supabase rejects the `redirectTo` parameter and the
invite / recovery email either never sends or sends with a broken
link. The recovery + invite emails both land on `/auth/recovery`
(Route Handler that does the PKCE exchange in a cookie-write-capable
context) — see PR #34 for the full root-cause writeup.

---

## 4. Common breakages

### "401 Unauthorized" from `signInWithOtp`

Almost always the `Redirect URLs` allowlist is missing your callback URL.
Add it (§3) and try again.

### Cookie set but middleware still redirects

The `AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET` value differs between the env that signed the
cookie and the env that verified it. After a rotation, all active admins
must sign in again — clear `alh_admin_sess` and re-sign in. If this
happens unexpectedly, check that Production / Preview / Dev all use the
same secret (or rotate them in lock-step).

### `notAdmin` error on a brand-new admin

The `auth.users` row was created (step 1) but the `public.admins` row was
skipped (step 2). Re-run the insert in step 2.

---

## 5. Applying schema migrations (PR 3.X — `inquiry_type`)

Phase 3 introduces an append-only migration `0004_inquiry_type.sql` that
adds a topic classifier to `public.leads` (`'general'` vs `'maintenance'`).
The migration is non-destructive — existing rows backfill to `'general'`
via the column default.

### Local Supabase (Docker)

If your local stack is running (`pnpm supabase status` reports services
up), re-apply the full schema + seed:

```powershell
pnpm supabase db reset
```

`db reset` runs every migration in order from a clean slate, so 0004
lands automatically. Use this for any local schema change — it's the
fastest way to verify migration files don't conflict.

### Remote (linked) Supabase

`db push` ships **only the migrations not yet applied** to the linked
remote project (`gvjmnwsqaymkxcsabjur`).

```powershell
pnpm supabase db push
```

You will see a confirmation prompt listing the migrations that will run.
Read it carefully — it should mention `0004_inquiry_type.sql` and
nothing else if Phase 1/2 migrations were already applied (they are).
Type `Y` to confirm.

The migration takes ~1 second on an empty `leads` table. No downtime.

### Verifying the column was created

```powershell
pnpm supabase db remote query "select column_name, data_type, column_default from information_schema.columns where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'leads' and column_name = 'inquiry_type';"
```

Expected output: one row, `inquiry_type | USER-DEFINED | 'general'::inquiry_type`.

### Regenerating database.types.ts (optional but recommended)

Once the remote schema reflects the new column, regenerate the typed
client. **Do NOT use plain `>` redirection in PowerShell** — its default
encoding is UTF-16 LE + CRLF, which Git flags as binary and which ESLint
/ tsc refuse to parse. Use one of these instead:

```powershell
# PowerShell — pipe through Out-File with explicit UTF-8 (no BOM):
pnpm supabase gen types typescript --project-id gvjmnwsqaymkxcsabjur `
  | Out-File -FilePath src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts -Encoding utf8 -NoNewline
```

```bash
# bash / WSL — plain redirection is UTF-8 by default:
pnpm supabase gen types typescript --project-id gvjmnwsqaymkxcsabjur > src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts
```

The repository ships a `.gitattributes` rule (`*.ts text eol=lf`) that
keeps Git consistent across platforms, but Git itself doesn't re-encode
UTF-16 → UTF-8; the regen command is what enforces the encoding.

Once `database.types.ts` is regenerated, the previous `as never` casts at
the insert boundaries (in `src/app/api/leads/route.ts`,
`src/app/api/whatsapp/track/route.ts`, `src/app/api/track/view/route.ts`)
were dropped in the post-3.2 housekeeping PR. `src/lib/audit.ts` still
needs one — the `diff: unknown` parameter never narrows cleanly into the
typed `Json` column — see the comment in that file.

### Rollback

If something is wrong, revert the migration with a SECOND migration —
don't edit `0004_inquiry_type.sql` in place (it's already in the remote
DB's `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` ledger and editing the file
won't re-run it).

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/0005_inquiry_type_rollback.sql
alter table public.leads drop column inquiry_type;
drop type inquiry_type;
```

Same `pnpm supabase db push` to ship the rollback.

## 6. Provisioning Vercel Blob (PR 3.5a — image upload)

The admin property form's image upload (`/api/upload`) writes to Vercel
Blob via the `@vercel/blob` SDK. Without a token configured the route
returns **503 `blob_not_configured`** by design — admins see a real
status, not a 500. Provisioning is a one-time setup per Vercel project.

### Step 1 — Create a Blob store

1. Open https://vercel.com/dashboard → select the **al-hewal** project.
2. Click the **Storage** tab in the top nav.
3. Click **Create Database** → choose **Blob** → click **Continue**.
4. Name the store `al-hewal-images` → choose **Primary region** =
   `Frankfurt (fra1)` (closest hop to Saudi visitors among the EU options).
5. **⚠️ Access mode must be `Public`** — Vercel asks during creation.
   The catalog renders property images via plain `<img src>` tags so
   the bytes MUST be publicly reachable. If you accidentally pick
   `Private`, see the "Recovery" subsection below.
6. Click **Create**. Vercel auto-creates a `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
   environment variable and links it to **all three Vercel environments**
   (Development / Preview / Production) for this project.

#### Recovery: my store is configured as Private

The admin upload form will surface a **503 `blob_store_not_public`**
error chip with the message "Blob store is private; recreate it with
public access." The Vercel runtime log shows:

```
[POST /api/upload] failed [Error]: {"code":null,"message":"Vercel Blob:
Cannot use public access on a private store. The store is configured
with private access."}
```

Access mode is set at store creation and CANNOT be changed in place.
Recovery:

1. Open the existing store in the Vercel dashboard → **Storage**.
2. Settings → **Delete this store**. Confirm (Vercel double-checks).
3. Repeat **Step 1** above, this time choosing **Public**.
4. Re-run `pnpm vercel env pull` locally to refresh
   `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (deleting + recreating the store rotates
   the token).
5. Re-deploy production from the Vercel dashboard so the new token
   propagates. Auto-deploys from `main` will pick it up on the next
   commit too.

No data loss to worry about — the store was empty (the upload bug
prevented any blobs from being written in the first place).

#### Recovery: "Vercel Blob: This store does not exist."

After deleting + recreating the store, the upload chip / Vercel
runtime log shows:

```
[POST /api/upload] failed [Error]: {"code":null,"message":"Vercel Blob:
This store does not exist."}
```

…and the chip reads `(blob_store_not_found)`. The
`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` that production is using points at the
deleted store. Setting `.env` / `.env.local` locally does NOT touch
what Production serves.

**Fix it from the Vercel dashboard:**

1. Project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**.
2. Find every `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` row. If multiple exist (one
   per store create), **delete every row** (every scope).
3. Project → **Storage** → the new `al-hewal-images` store →
   **Connect Project** → al-hewal. Vercel re-issues a fresh token
   and links it to Production / Preview / Development automatically.
4. Project → **Deployments** → latest → **⋯** → **Redeploy** →
   uncheck "Use existing Build Cache" → confirm. The new token only
   takes effect on a deploy.
5. Locally, re-run `pnpm vercel env pull .env.local` so dev matches
   prod.

The next upload either succeeds with a 200 OR the chip reports a
different error code that pinpoints the next layer.

### Step 2 — Pull the token into your local `.env`

Local `pnpm dev` needs the same token so admins can test uploads
without a deployed preview. From the project root:

```powershell
# From d:\Work\Projects\AL-Hewal\al-hewal
pnpm vercel env pull .env.local
# Or, if .env is your local convention:
pnpm vercel env pull .env
```

Either command writes every Vercel env var (including the new
`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`) into the file. The file is `.gitignored`.

### Step 3 — Verify

Quick sanity check that the env loader sees the token:

```powershell
pnpm exec node -e "console.log('token len:', (process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN ?? '').length)"
```

Expect a length around 60+ characters (the token is a long
`vercel_blob_rw_...` string). A `length: 0` means the env wasn't
loaded — check the file path you pulled into.

Then start the dev server and hit the route as an admin:

```powershell
pnpm dev
# In another shell, with admin cookie set:
# (the upload UI lands in PR 3.5b — for now this just confirms the gate)
```

The route should **stop returning 503** once the token is present —
the next failure mode is the actual handleUpload + sharp pipeline,
which only fires on a real client upload from PR 3.5b's UI.

### Step 4 — Local-dev webhook caveat

Vercel Blob's client-upload pattern delivers the **`onUploadCompleted`
webhook** to your deployment URL. On `pnpm dev` that's
`http://localhost:3000`, which Vercel **cannot reach**. The browser
upload itself works locally; the post-upload sharp processing only
fires once you test on a Vercel preview deployment or use a tunnel
(e.g. `ngrok http 3000` and set its public URL as the callback).

For PR 3.5a we accept this — the actual upload happy-path testing
moves to a preview deployment when 3.5b's UI lands. CI's E2E suite
only exercises the pre-Blob gates (auth, JSON validity, missing-token
503), which work without a real token.

### Free-tier sanity check

Vercel Blob's Hobby plan includes **5 GB storage** and **100 GB
bandwidth** per month. Each upload produces 2 stored variants (AVIF

- WebP) capped at 2400 px longest edge ≈ ~150–500 KB combined per
  photo. That headroom hosts ~5 000+ property photos comfortably.
  Monitor in the Vercel dashboard → Storage → the store you created.

### Rotating the token

The `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` rotates from the same Storage page in
the Vercel dashboard (**Settings** → **Rotate token**). After
rotation re-run `pnpm vercel env pull` locally. Production picks up
the new token on the next deployment automatically.

---

## 7. Applying migration 0005 (PR 3.5b — `property_images.webp_url`)

PR 3.5b adds a nullable `webp_url text` column to `property_images`
so the public `<picture>` element can declare both AVIF and WebP
sources. Old rows (uploaded before 3.5b) leave the column NULL; the
admin gallery + the public catalog both fall back to `blob_url`
(AVIF) when WebP is absent.

### Local (Docker Supabase)

```powershell
Set-Location "d:\Work\Projects\AL-Hewal\al-hewal"
pnpm supabase db reset
```

This wipes the local DB, re-runs every migration (0001 → 0005), and
re-seeds. Then regenerate the typed client:

```powershell
pnpm supabase gen types typescript --local --schema public > src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts
```

Commit the regenerated `database.types.ts` alongside the migration.

### Remote (linked Supabase)

```powershell
pnpm supabase db push
```

Append-only — same rule as 0004. If anything is wrong, ship a 0006
follow-up migration to fix it; never edit 0005 in place after the
remote DB has applied it.

### Verifying the column was created

```powershell
pnpm supabase db diff --linked
```

A clean diff means the local + remote schemas match. After a push,
re-run `pnpm vercel env pull` is NOT required (no env vars
changed).

### Rollback

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/0006_property_images_webp_url_rollback.sql
alter table public.property_images drop column webp_url;
```

`pnpm supabase db push` ships the rollback.

---

## 8. Configure custom SMTP for invite + password-reset emails

Supabase Hobby ships with a built-in SMTP relay that is **rate-limited
to ~30 emails per hour** and frequently silently drops sends. Symptom:
super_admin invites a new admin, the `public.admins` row is created,
but the invitee never receives the email. Same applies to the
`/auth/forgot` password-recovery flow.

Three paths to fix this, in order of how much setup they need:

| Path                               | Setup time                | Requirements                                   | Daily cap                         | When to use                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A. Gmail SMTP**                  | ~5 min                    | Owner's Gmail account + 2-Step Verification on | 500 (personal) / 2000 (Workspace) | **Now** — no domain yet, just need invites to work to any recipient |
| **B. Resend with verified domain** | ~30 min (DNS propagation) | Owns a domain whose DNS can be edited          | 100/day, 3000/month (free)        | Production — once Al Hewal has a domain                             |
| **C. SQL fallback**                | ~1 min per admin          | Supabase Studio access                         | n/a (no email sent)               | Emergency — SMTP broken AND a new admin needs access TODAY          |

### Path A: Gmail SMTP (no domain needed)

Gmail's SMTP server lets the owner send from their own Gmail address
to any recipient without verifying a domain. Caps are 500 messages
per day for personal Gmail (`@gmail.com`) and 2000 for Google
Workspace (`@your-company-domain`). For Al Hewal's volume (a handful
of invites + occasional password resets) that's effectively unlimited.

#### Step A1 — Enable 2-Step Verification on the Gmail account

1. https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Under **How you sign in to Google**, switch **2-Step Verification** to **On**.
3. Follow the prompts (phone + SMS or Authenticator app).

Google requires 2-Step Verification before it will issue an App Password.

#### Step A2 — Create a Gmail App Password

1. https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. **App name**: `Supabase SMTP`.
3. Click **Create**.
4. Google shows the password as `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx` — the spaces
   are visual grouping ONLY, NOT part of the password. Copy the 16
   characters WITHOUT the spaces (`xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` — one
   continuous block). Pasting the spaces along with the characters
   causes Gmail's SMTP to reject the credentials with
   `535 5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` (see the
   troubleshooting block under Step A4).
5. Store the 16-char password in a password manager — you can't
   re-view it later.

#### Step A3 — Plug Gmail into Supabase

1. https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvjmnwsqaymkxcsabjur/auth/smtp
2. Toggle **Enable custom SMTP** to **on**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Sender email**: the owner's full Gmail address (e.g.
     `hamednallah@gmail.com`). MUST match the Gmail account that
     issued the App Password — Gmail rejects mismatched From addresses.
   - **Sender name**: `Al Hewal Admin` (what recipients see in their inbox).
   - **Host**: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - **Port**: `587` (STARTTLS) — `465` (SSL) also works.
   - **Username**: the owner's full Gmail address (same as Sender email).
   - **Password**: the 16-character App Password from Step A2.
   - **Minimum interval**: leave at default (60s).
4. Click **Save**.

#### Step A4 — Verify

1. From the admin UI, invite a real recipient email.
2. Recipient checks their inbox (also Spam — Gmail-from-Gmail can
   occasionally land in Spam at first; once recipients click "Not
   spam" once, future sends land in Inbox).
3. Invite link clicks through `/auth/recovery` → `/auth/set-password`.

#### When to switch off Path A

The Gmail address is fine for an internal tool. Switch to Path B
(Resend + verified domain) once Al Hewal has a domain — then the
sender becomes `invites@al-hewal.com` instead of the owner's
personal Gmail, which reads more legitimate to admin invitees and
isolates transactional mail from the owner's inbox.

### Path B: Resend with a verified domain

### Step 1 — Provision a Resend account (free tier)

1. https://resend.com/signup — sign up with your team email.
2. **Verify a domain** — this is REQUIRED, not optional. Resend's
   shared `onboarding@resend.dev` sender refuses to email anyone
   other than the Resend account owner (the 403 surfaces as
   "validation_error: You can only send testing emails to your own
   email address"). Without a verified domain the invite flow
   appears to work but every external recipient is silently rejected.
   - https://resend.com/domains → **Add Domain**
   - Pick the domain you control (e.g. `al-hewal.com` — must be a
     domain whose DNS you can edit; subdomains like `mail.al-hewal.com`
     also work and isolate transactional mail from your apex).
   - Resend prints 3 DNS records (SPF + DKIM + DMARC):
     - **TXT** at the domain root: SPF (`v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all`)
     - **TXT** at `resend._domainkey.<your-domain>`: DKIM (`p=…`)
     - **TXT** at `_dmarc.<your-domain>`: DMARC (recommended)
   - Paste them into your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Namecheap, GoDaddy,
     Vercel DNS, …). Wait 1–5 minutes, click **Verify** in Resend.
3. **API Keys** → **Create API Key** → name it `supabase-smtp` →
   permission `Sending access` → **Create**. Copy the value
   (`re_…`) — Resend only shows it once.

#### Test-only workaround (no domain ready yet)

If you need to validate the end-to-end invite flow before you have a
domain, Resend will let you send from `onboarding@resend.dev` ONLY to
the email address registered on your Resend account. To test:

1. Make sure your Resend account email is your Al Hewal super-admin
   email (or add a teammate's email to the Resend account).
2. From the admin UI, invite that exact email address. The 403 won't
   fire because the recipient matches.
3. Click through the invite link, set a password, verify the flow.
4. Then come back to Step 1.2 above and verify a real domain before
   inviting anyone else.

### Step 2 — Plug Resend's SMTP creds into Supabase

1. https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvjmnwsqaymkxcsabjur/auth/smtp
2. Toggle **Enable custom SMTP** to **on**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Sender email**: `invites@<your-verified-domain>` (e.g.
     `invites@al-hewal.com`). MUST be on the domain you verified in
     Step 1.2 — using `onboarding@resend.dev` here causes Resend to
     reject every recipient other than your Resend account owner.
   - **Sender name**: `Al Hewal`.
   - **Host**: `smtp.resend.com`
   - **Port**: `587`
   - **Username**: `resend`
   - **Password**: the `re_…` key from Step 1.3.
   - **Minimum interval**: leave at default (60s) — Resend has its
     own rate limits.
4. Click **Save**.

### Step 3 — Verify

Run `/auth/forgot` from a browser with a real admin email. The reset
email should land in the inbox within a few seconds. Failing that,
check:

- Resend dashboard → **Emails** — if Resend received the request,
  Supabase did its part. Resend's UI shows the deliverability outcome.
- Supabase dashboard → **Authentication** → **Logs** — if Supabase
  rejected our SMTP request, the error message is here.

#### Specific failure: Resend 403 `validation_error`

If the Resend Emails dashboard shows a 403 with body:

```
"name": "validation_error",
"message": "You can only send testing emails to your own email
address (you@example.com). To send emails to other recipients,
please verify a domain at resend.com/domains, and change the
`from` address to an email using this domain."
```

…that means the Supabase Sender email is still `onboarding@resend.dev`
(or any `*.resend.dev` address). Resend refuses to email recipients
other than the Resend account owner from the shared domain. The
upstream chip in the admin UI surfaces this as
`(invite_smtp_failed)`. Fix:

1. Verify a domain (Step 1.2 above) if you skipped it.
2. Update the Supabase Sender email (Step 2) to use that verified
   domain instead of `onboarding@resend.dev`.
3. Save and retry the invite.

### Step 4 — Customise the templates (optional)

Supabase ships default English templates that say "Confirm your
signup" / "Reset your password". The invite email is fine as-is for
Al Hewal's case, but for the recovery template you'll want to update
the call-to-action URL since the `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` placeholder
already points at our `redirectTo` (`/auth/recovery?type=…&locale=…`):

1. https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvjmnwsqaymkxcsabjur/auth/templates
2. Pick **Invite user** → edit subject/body if you want
   Arabic-bilingual copy.
3. Pick **Reset password** → same.

Leave the link as `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` — Supabase substitutes the
real `redirectTo` value at send time.

### Path C: SQL fallback (no SMTP at all)

If SMTP is broken AND you need to onboard an admin immediately,
runbook §1 ("Resetting an existing admin's password") still applies.
Insert the `public.admins` row by hand, then set the auth.users
password via the SQL Editor:

```sql
update auth.users
   set encrypted_password = extensions.crypt('NewStrongPassword!',
                                              extensions.gen_salt('bf')),
       email_confirmed_at  = coalesce(email_confirmed_at, now())
 where email = 'new-admin@al-hewal.sa';
```

Hand the password to the new admin out-of-band.

## 9. Applying migration 0006 (admin trigger service-role bypass)

PR fix #40 ships migration `0006_admin_trigger_service_role_bypass.sql`
to repair the `admins_protect_privileged_fields` trigger introduced in 0003. The original trigger's bypass clause inspected `rolsuper` on
`current_user`, which never matched `service_role` (PostgREST's role
for service-role JWT calls — `bypassrls` but **not** `rolsuper`). As a
result, EVERY service-role UPDATE that touched `admins.{tier, status,
email}` was being rejected with `42501 — status may only be changed by
a super_admin`, including:

- The PR #39 invite-acceptance flip (`status: 'pending_invite' →
'active'`) in `establishAdminSession`.
- Every admin-management row action (promote / demote / deactivate /
  reactivate) shipped in PR #33.

The migration recreates the trigger body with a correct bypass clause:

```sql
if current_user in ('service_role', 'supabase_admin', 'postgres') then
    return new;
end if;
```

The non-bypass path (a signed-in authenticated user via the
`authenticated` role) is unchanged: the trigger still calls
`is_super_admin()` and still raises 42501 on tier / status / email /
id diffs by a non-super_admin.

### Local (Docker Supabase)

```powershell
Set-Location "d:\Work\Projects\AL-Hewal\al-hewal"
pnpm supabase db reset
```

This wipes the local DB and re-runs every migration (0001 → 0006). No
typed-client regeneration is required — the migration changes only the
trigger function body; no table schema changed.

### Remote (linked Supabase)

```powershell
pnpm supabase db push
```

Append-only — same rule as 0004 / 0005. If the body is wrong, ship a
0007 follow-up; never edit 0006 in place after the remote DB has
applied it.

### Verifying the trigger body in production

In Supabase Studio → SQL Editor:

```sql
select pg_get_functiondef('public.admins_protect_privileged_fields()'::regprocedure);
```

The output should include `current_user in ('service_role',
'supabase_admin', 'postgres')`. If it still includes
`(select rolsuper from pg_roles where rolname = current_user)`, the
push did not land — re-run `pnpm supabase db push` and check the CLI
output for errors.

### Smoke-testing the fix (no admin needed)

1. Sign in as the bootstrap super_admin at `/<locale>/auth/login`.
2. Go to `/<locale>/admin/admins`.
3. Invite a fresh email (use a `+test` alias if you don't have a
   second mailbox handy: `you+invitetest@gmail.com`).
4. Open the invite email, click the link.
5. Land on `/<locale>/auth/set-password` (welcoming copy).
6. Submit a password.
7. Expected: land on `/<locale>/admin` authenticated.
8. Back in Supabase Studio → Table editor → `public.admins`, confirm
   the new row's `status` flipped from `pending_invite` to `active`.

If steps 7 or 8 fail, re-check the trigger body via the SQL above —
the migration must be applied before the flip works.

### Rollback (only if the new bypass clause is somehow unsafe)

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/0007_admin_trigger_rollback.sql
-- Restores the 0003 bypass clause. Re-introduces the bug that
-- 0006 fixed; only ship this if 0006 turns out to be wrong AND
-- there is a better replacement queued behind it.
create or replace function public.admins_protect_privileged_fields()
  returns trigger language plpgsql
as $$
declare
  is_super boolean;
begin
  if (select rolsuper from pg_roles where rolname = current_user) then
    return new;
  end if;
  -- ...body unchanged from 0003...
end;
$$;
```

## 10. Phase 3 closeout — `v0.3.0 — Admin Command Center`

This is the closeout procedure that runs once PR 3.7 merges and the
Admin Command Center ships in full. Two manual steps live here
because they can't be automated from inside the PR itself.

### 10.1. Verify the happy-path E2E against the preview deploy

The new `tests/e2e/admin-happy-path.spec.ts` is preview-only — it
skips in CI without `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (see the spec's header
comment). To validate the full create → upload → publish → public
flow against the actual preview deploy, run it locally pointed at
the preview URL with the preview's Blob token exported:

```bash
# In a PowerShell session (Windows):
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL = 'https://al-hewal.vercel.app'
$env:BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN = '<the preview deploy token from Vercel env>'
pnpm test:e2e -- admin-happy-path
```

(Bash/zsh equivalent: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=... BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=... pnpm test:e2e -- admin-happy-path`.)

Expected: 1 test, 1 passed in ~20-30 s. The spec hard-deletes the
property it created in `afterEach`, so re-runs do not accumulate.

If the spec fails:

- **Form submit returns validation error** — read
  `getByRole('alert')` to see the localised error code; the spec's
  inputs are deliberately above every Zod min/max, so a failure
  here means the form schema drifted.
- **Upload tile never appears** — confirm the Blob token is for
  the same store the preview deploy is wired to (per runbook §6's
  token-mismatch recovery). Stale token from a previous store
  recreate is the most common cause.
- **Public detail page returns 404 after publish** — confirm the
  property's `status` actually flipped from `draft` to `published`
  via Supabase Studio. If it did and the public page still 404s,
  this is a force-dynamic / revalidation regression — file under
  the same memory as `feedback_prefer_force_static`.

### 10.2. Tag `v0.3.0`

After PR 3.7 merges to `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "Admin Command Center"
git push origin v0.3.0
```

The tag's message is intentionally short — release notes live in
the CHANGELOG (or, until one exists, in the merged PR's body and
the master plan's Phase 3 done-criteria list).

### 10.3. The bilingual PDF export scope-cut

The master plan originally listed bilingual PDF export of leads as
a Phase 3 done-criterion. After scoping during the PR 3.7 design
session, the PDF was carved out indefinitely:

- The CSV export shipped in PR #47 (UTF-8 BOM + RFC 4180) reads
  correctly in Excel and Numbers in both Arabic and English. The
  bilingual export need is met.
- A branded PDF at any row cap that would make it useful (≥ 500
  rows) exceeds Vercel's 10-second free-tier function envelope
  during fontkit's Arabic-glyph shaping pass, and a cover-page +
  table + per-record-appendix design would have produced a
  ~900-page document at the 2,500-row cap the owner first chose.

If a stakeholder asks for a branded PDF later, the data plumbing
(`listAllLeadsForExport` + the audit shape) is already in place
from PR #47, so the PDF route can be added without a refactor.
The design exploration is captured in
`docs/specs/2026-05-20-pr-3.7-phase-3-wrap-design.md` for the next
session that picks this up.
